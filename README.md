| `latest_calib.py`       | Performs camera calibration using chessboard images. Saves undistorted outputs and calibration matrices.         |
| `same sync movement.py` | Drives 3 stepper motors simultaneously in a synchronized manner.                                                 |
| `diff movement.py`      | Controls stepper motors independently with limit switch safety checks.                                           |
| `streams.py`            | Captures live video from PiCamera2, applies preprocessing (CLAHE, denoise, sharpen), and saves processed frames. |
| `Motor controls.docx`   | Documentation explaining the difference between same and independent motor movements.                            |
| `corners.jpg`           | Sample chessboard image used for camera calibration.                                                             |
